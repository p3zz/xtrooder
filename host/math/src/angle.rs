/*
contains some wrapping functions that enables the use of micromath
with f64.
As explained in the rust book:
- Casting from an f32 to an f64 is perfect and lossless
- Casting from an f64 to an f32 will produce the closest possible f32 **
if necessary, rounding is according to roundTiesToEven mode ***
on overflow, infinity (of the same sign as the input) is produced
** if f64-to-f32 casts with this rounding mode and overflow behavior are
not supported natively by the hardware, these casts will likely be slower than expected.
*** as defined in IEEE 754-2008 ยง4.3.1: pick the nearest floating point
number, preferring the one with an even least significant digit if exactly
halfway between two floating point numbers.
